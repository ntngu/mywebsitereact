# MyWebsiteReact
My website, remade using React.


## Description
I originally created my website using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a few months ago. 

I learned a lot from that process and it was fun, but I quickly realized the work to add and change stuff would be annoying.

My process for editing the website involved copy and pasting files over the AWS command line.

I got tired of doing that and wanted to learn about continuous integration so I pivoted to implementing React and AWS Amplify to save time on updating my website.

## Technologies
I have been wanting to use React I decided to use it for my website.

I have heard things about AWS Amplify; it's opinionated, gets annoying for scaling, etc. 

For my use case, the website doesn't have any back-end capability and really is only an interface, so the quick to use setup of Amplify works for me.

I registered my domain name using Namecheap. Nothing else to say about that.

## Future Endeavors
I plan to implement a blog section once I start and finish work on creating a blog API. 

I think I will accomplish this over the next month or so.
